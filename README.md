Change name is the action

this action rant through reducer
  reducer takes the action and takes the action. and it will know what to do . we will be having a method to
  change the name. Reducer name comes from redux.
  Reducers changes the state in such a way that , it takes the old state and applies this action on the old state and it gives us back the new state. 
  Here the state is immutable , instead of changing the whole state - it takes the old state as basis and changes it and will give us new state.
  Note: You no need to follow with this immutable approach but it is good to follow as the state is always unique
  Store state  There is only one store which holds our applicatio state. but we can have multiple reducers and store will send the new state to interested components and applies changes.
